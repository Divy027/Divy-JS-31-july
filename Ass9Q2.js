// there are 2 types of scope :- global scooe and local or block scope 
// global scope is the variables which can be accessed from any block of code.
// variable declared at the top of code and variable declared with 'var' keyword have global scope, function declared with 'fuunction' keyword can be called before declaration
// variable declared with 'let' and 'const' inside a block of code have a local scope.

// closures
